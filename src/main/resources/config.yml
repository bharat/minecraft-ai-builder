# AI Builder Configuration
#
# API KEY: The recommended way is to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
# (via a .env file — see .env.example). The env var takes priority over this config.
# You can also set it here or use /aiconfig apikey <key> in-game.
# Get your API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
openai-api-key: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# Model to use (gpt-4o is recommended for best building results)
openai-model: "gpt-4o"

# Maximum blocks that can be placed in a single build command
max-blocks: 10000

# Build speed: blocks placed per tick (20 ticks = 1 second)
blocks-per-tick: 50

# Whether to allow AI to respond to chat messages starting with "AI,"
chat-trigger-enabled: true

# Chat trigger prefix (case-insensitive)
chat-trigger-prefix: "AI,"
